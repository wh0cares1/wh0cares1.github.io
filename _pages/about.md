## wh0cares@1337:~$ whoami

Security Researcher. I'm interested in the areas of web browsers, operating systems, virtualizations, web applications, IoT, and baseband. I spend a significant amount of my time reading documentation, developing N-Day exploits, doing root cause analysis, and doing variant analysis.
