# Fundamentals
## Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
**Adaptive compiler**
- **Standard Interpreter at Launch**
    - Initially, the application runs using a basic interpreter.
    - This allows quick startup times since no compilation is performed upfront.
- **Hot Spot Detection**
    - The VM monitors runtime behavior to identify frequently executed portions of the code, known as _hot spots_.
    - These hot spots are analyzed for potential optimizations.
- **Selective Compilation**
    - Only performance-critical code is compiled into machine code, while seldom-used code remains interpreted.
    - This balances optimization effort with runtime performance.
- **Optimization Techniques**
    - **Inlining**: Frequently invoked methods are embedded directly into the caller, reducing method call overhead.
    - **Loop Unrolling**: Iterative loops are expanded to reduce the number of iterations and branch instructions.
    - **Speculative Optimizations**: Assumptions about code behavior (e.g., object types) are made to optimize performance. These optimizations can be reverted if assumptions prove incorrect (deoptimization).

**Rapid Memory Allocation**
The HotSpot VM allocates memory for objects efficiently using *Thread-Local Allocation Buffers (TLABs)*:
- Each thread is provided a small chunk of memory to minimize contention with other threads.
- Allocation from TLABs is extremely fast (essentially a pointer increment).

**[Garbage Collection](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/23/gctuning/garbage-collector-implementation.html#GUID-23844E39-7499-400C-A579-032B68E53073)**
- **Serial GC**
    - Designed for single-threaded environments.
    - Performs stop-the-world garbage collection.
- **Parallel GC (Throughput Collector)**
    - Utilizes multiple threads for both minor and major garbage collections.
    - Suitable for applications requiring high throughput.
- **Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS) Collector**
    - Focuses on reducing application pause times by performing most of its work concurrently with the application threads.
- **G1 GC (Garbage-First)**
    - Divides the heap into regions and prioritizes garbage collection in regions with the most garbage.
    - Ideal for applications with large heaps and low-latency requirements.
- **ZGC (Z Garbage Collector)** and **Shenandoah**
    - Advanced low-latency garbage collectors.
    - Perform concurrent compaction, reducing pause times to a few milliseconds even for large heaps.

**[Thread synchronization](https://www.javatpoint.com/synchronization-in-java)**
- Efficient Locking Mechanisms
    - Biased Locking: Locks are biased toward a single thread to avoid overhead when contention is low.
    - Lightweight Locking: CAS-based (Compare-And-Swap) locks are used for uncontended locks to reduce synchronization costs.
    - Heavyweight Locks: Used when threads compete heavily for a resource.
- Scalable Thread Management
    - The HotSpot VM is designed to handle a large number of threads efficiently, scaling well on shared-memory multiprocessor servers.
- Thread Coordination
    - Threads cooperate during garbage collection and JIT compilation, ensuring minimal disruption to application execution.

**Class Loaders**

JVM uses class loaders as there is no runtime linker.
- Bootstrap ClassLoader
	- The **root** of the ClassLoader hierarchy.
	- It is part of the **JVM implementation** and written in native code (not Java).
	- Does not extend the `java.lang.ClassLoader` class, but acts as the **superclass** for other ClassLoaders.
	- Loads the **core Java classes** required for basic functioning, such as classes from the `java.lang`, `java.util`, `java.io`, `java.net`, and `java.sql` packages.
	- **Classpath** for the Bootstrap ClassLoader is typically hardcoded and points to locations like: `<JAVA_HOME>/lib`, `rt.jar`, `charsets.jar`, or similar core libraries.
	- Cannot be directly accessed or modified by developers.
- Extension/Platform ClassLoader
	- **Child ClassLoader** of the Bootstrap ClassLoader.
	- Used for loading Java extensions (optional packages).
	- Loads classes from the `$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext` directory or any directories specified in the `java.ext.dirs` system property.
	- Handles classes such as cryptographic providers, additional API libraries, or any external libraries placed in the `ext` directory.
	- If a class is not found in the `ext` directory, the Extension ClassLoader delegates the request to the Bootstrap ClassLoader.
- System/Application ClassLoader
	- The **child** of the Extension ClassLoader.
	- Responsible for loading application-specific classes and resources.
	- Loads classes specified by the **`classpath`** environment variable or passed via the `-cp` or `-classpath` JVM argument.
    - Typically includes directories, JAR files, or compiled `.class` files from the project workspace.
    - Points to the **current working directory** (`.`).
	- Developers can customize it using tools like Maven or Gradle for dependency management.
	- It is an instance of `java.lang.ClassLoader`.
	- Most user-defined classes and third-party libraries are loaded using the System ClassLoader.
- Custom ClassLoaders
	- Create custom ClassLoaders by extending the `java.lang.ClassLoader` class for advanced use cases like:
		- Loading classes from custom locations (e.g., network, encrypted files).
		- Implementing dynamic module systems or plugin architectures.

**[Java Bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode)**
- Java bytecode allows "write once, run anywhere" by abstracting machine-specific details to the underlying hardware.
- The bytecode format is designed to be *compact*, making it suitable for network transmission.
- Optimized for quick interpretation or Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.
- Bytecode runs inside the JVM sandbox, offering better security and preventing direct access to underlying hardware or OS.
- Java provides the `javap` tool to inspect compiled `.class` files and view their bytecode: `javap -c Test.class`.
- List of [Java bytecode instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_bytecode_instructions).
- Advanced Bytecode Inspection Tools
	- [ASM Framework](https://asm.ow2.io/): Analyze or modify bytecode programmatically.
	- [Byte Buddy](https://bytebuddy.net/): Simplifies creating or modifying bytecode at runtime.
	- [Javassist](http://www.javassist.org/): High-level API for editing bytecode dynamically.
