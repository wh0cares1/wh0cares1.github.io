# Mindmap
<img src="/images/dns.png">

# Shape like a tree
The DNS structure follows a hierarchical, tree-like system, starting from root servers and branching out through different levels of domain names.

## Information
- **WHOIS:** A query-response protocol providing information about domain registrations. The newer **[RDAP](https://www.openrdap.org/api)** (Registration Data Access Protocol) aims to modernize WHOIS with better features.
- **Domain Transfer:** The transfer of domain ownership between registrars follows strict policies set by domain authorities.

## Management
### ICANN
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) oversees global DNS operations, working with:
- **Registries:** Organizations that manage top-level domains (TLDs).
- **Registrar:** Companies that handle domain name registrations for users.
- **Registrant:** The individual or entity that owns a domain name.

### Lifecycle
Domain names follow a lifecycle from registration, through active use, to expiration, renewal, or deletion.

## Zones
### Delegation
DNS delegation distributes the responsibility for managing different parts of the namespace to various authoritative DNS servers.

### Authoritative DNS Servers
These servers provide the definitive answers for their designated zones, containing all DNS records for the zone. Readmore: [How to find a domain's authoritative nameservers](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/01/11/how-to-find-a-domain-s-authoritative-nameserver/)

### Zone Transfer
Zone transfers move DNS data between servers, often to synchronize secondary servers with the primary authoritative server.

## Root Zones
- **TLD (Top-Level Domain):** The highest level in the DNS hierarchy (e.g., .com, .org).
    - **ccLTD:** Managed by a contry. Readmore: [ISO 3166](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search)
    - **gTLD:** Managed by commercial or non-profit organization.
- **2nd/3rd LD:** Second and third-level domains add further subdivisions, commonly representing specific websites or services.
- **IDNs (Internationalized Domain Names):** Domains that include non-ASCII characters, enabling broader global use. Readmore: [RFC 3492](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3492)
- Readmore: [IANA](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers), [Root Servers](https://root-servers.org/)

## Tools
- **[nslookup](https://www.nslookup.io/)** and **dig:** These tools are essential for querying DNS information and diagnosing DNS issues. Readmore: [A little tool to make DNS queries](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/02/24/a-little-tool-to-make-dns-queries/), [How to use dig](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/12/04/how-to-use-dig/), [New tool: Mess with DNS!](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/12/15/mess-with-dns/)

# Functioning like a database
The DNS (Domain Name System) operates as a vast, distributed database. It maps human-readable domain names to machine-recognizable IP addresses and other critical information for internet functionality.

## Record Type
Each record type in DNS serves a distinct purpose, mapping different types of information.

### Mapping
- **A and AAAA:** These records map a domain to an IP address. The A record handles IPv4 addresses, while the AAAA record supports IPv6, enabling connectivity across different IP versions.
- **CNAME:** This stands for Canonical Name, mapping one domain name to another, useful for aliasing one domain to another for better DNS management.
- **PTR:** The Pointer Record maps an IP address back to a domain, enabling reverse DNS lookups, often used in verifying the identity of IP addresses in email systems.

### Information
- **TXT:** Text records can store any arbitrary text but are most commonly used to hold **SPF** (Sender Policy Framework) records, which specify which mail servers are allowed to send emails on behalf of a domain. Readmore: [RFC7208](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7208)
- **SRV:** Service records map hostnames to specific services and ports, critical for applications like VoIP (Voice over IP) or LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).

### Security
- **DNSSEC:** DNS Security Extensions add an authentication layer to DNS, ensuring that the data received in response to DNS queries has not been tampered with, helping to prevent attacks like DNS spoofing.

---
## Operation
DNS operates through complex protocols and functionalities to resolve domain names efficiently and securely.

### Functionality
- **Operational DNS:** DNS servers around the world operate in a hierarchy, from root servers to local resolvers, ensuring the system remains available and accurate. Readmore: [A toy DNS resolver](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/02/01/a-dns-resolver-in-80-lines-of-go/)
- **DNS Protocols:** DNS primarily uses UDP for faster, lightweight queries but falls back to TCP when necessary, especially for zone transfers or larger responses. Readmore: [DNS Packet Structure](https://mislove.org/teaching/cs4700/spring11/handouts/project1-primer.pdf), [Format of a DNS packets](https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/en/doc/EDOC1100174721/f917b5d7/dns)
- **Transport Protocols:** TCP and UDP are the main transport protocols for DNS, with extensions like **[EDNS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6891)** (Extension Mechanisms for DNS) supporting larger message sizes and additional features.
- Readmore : [Why might you run your own DNS server?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/01/05/why-might-you-run-your-own-dns-server-/)

### Query
- **Recursive:** A DNS resolver performs recursive queries by querying multiple servers on behalf of the client to find the correct answer. Readmore: [The multiple meanings of "nameserver" and "DNS resolver"](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/02/14/some-dns-terminology/)
- **Glue Record:** This is a crucial component in DNS delegation, used to avoid circular dependencies in the name resolution process. Readmore: [Rethinking the Security Threats of Stale DNS Glue Records](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/zhang-yunyi-rethinking)
- **Dynamic Response:** DNS responses can be dynamically generated based on request parameters, enabling more flexible and intelligent DNS behavior.

### Performance
- **DNS Caching:** To improve performance, DNS servers cache responses, reducing the need to perform repetitive queries. Readmore: [DNS "propagation" is actually caches expiring](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/12/06/dns-doesn-t-propagate/), [The Maginot Line: Attacking the Boundary of DNS Caching Protection](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/li-xiang)
- **Negative Caching:** DNS servers also cache negative responses (e.g., non-existent domain queries) to prevent excessive repeated lookup failures.

### Services
- **Public DNS:** Public DNS services like Google Public DNS or Cloudflare provide faster and more secure DNS resolution compared to ISP-operated DNS.
- **DDNS:** Dynamic DNS services allow domain records to be automatically updated when an IP address changes, useful for devices with dynamic IPs.

## Email
DNS is integral to the email transmission process, ensuring that emails reach their intended recipients.

### Transmission
- **SMTP:** The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol governs how email servers send messages between one another.
- **MX:** Mail Exchanger records within DNS specify which mail servers should receive emails for a domain.

### Security
#### Authentication
- **Prevent Spoofing (DMARC):** DMARC is an email authentication protocol that uses **SPF** and **DKIM** (DomainKeys Identified Mail) to prevent email spoofing and phishing. SPF ensures the sending server is authorized, while DKIM verifies the email’s integrity through a digital signature.

#### Transport
- **MTA-STS:** Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security enforces the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security) for secure email transmission.

- **DANE:** DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities uses DNSSEC to ensure that TLS certificates are valid and properly authenticated.

### Brand Identity
- **BIMI:** Brand Indicators for Message Identification allow companies to display their logos in email inboxes, increasing brand trust and recognition through authenticated emails.

---
## Debugging
Diagnosing and troubleshooting DNS issues is crucial for ensuring smooth operations.

### Diagnosing
- **Root Cause:** Identifying the root cause of DNS failures often involves checking the flow of queries from resolvers to authoritative servers. Readmore: [How do you tell if a problem is caused by DNS?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/11/04/how-do-you-tell-if-a-problem-is-caused-by-dns/), [Some ways DNS can break](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/01/15/some-ways-dns-can-break/)
- **DNSSEC Issues:** Misconfigurations in DNSSEC can result in DNS failures due to authentication issues.

### Performance Analysis
- **DNS Traffic:** Analyzing DNS traffic helps in understanding performance bottlenecks or detecting abnormal activity, such as DDoS attacks.
- **Slow or Failing DNS:** Performance issues might arise from overloaded servers, poor caching configurations, or network issues. Readmore : [What happens when you update your DNS?](https://jvns.ca/blog/how-updating-dns-works/)

### Configuration
- **Cache Invalidation:** Caching can lead to outdated responses; invalidating the cache forces DNS to retrieve fresh information.
- **DNS Change:** Changing DNS configurations may introduce issues, such as wrong IP mappings or delays due to TTL (Time-to-Live) values.
- **Lame Delegation:** This occurs when a DNS server is listed as authoritative for a domain but cannot respond to queries due to misconfiguration of NS (Name Server) records.
