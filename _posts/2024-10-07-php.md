# Fundamentals
## Predefined Variables
PHP provides several predefined arrays to access global data. These include:
- `Superglobals`: Built-in variables that are always available in all scopes.
- `$GLOBALS`: References all variables available in global scope.
- `$_REQUEST`: HTTP Request variables
- `$_GET`: Data sent via HTTP GET method.
- `$_POST`: Data sent via HTTP POST method.
- `$_COOKIE`: Cookies sent to the script.
- `$_SESSION`: Stores session variables across multiple pages.
	- Use strong session cookie flags (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`).
- `$_SERVER`: Server environment variables, including headers, paths, and script locations. Variables like `$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']` or `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` provide information about the request.
- `$_FILES`: HTTP File Upload variables.
- `$_ENV`: Environment variables.
- `$php_errormsg`: The previous error message
- `$http_response_header`: HTTP response headers
- `$argc`: The number of arguments passed to script
- `$argv`: Array of arguments passed to script

**Security Note**: Input validation is crucial.

## Typing
**Loose and Strict Typing**:
- [PHP’s type juggling](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.type-juggling.php) can lead to unexpected behavior in loose comparisons (`==`). For example, `0 == "abc"` returns true.
- **Security Note**: Always use strict comparisons (`===`) in critical parts of your code (e.g., password verification, authentication checks) to avoid logic flaws.

## Class and Object
**[Namespace](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.definition.php)**:
- Helps avoid name collisions by grouping related classes. Used in larger projects where many classes may have the same names.
- **Security Note**: Improper handling of namespaces and autoloading can lead to file inclusion attacks if class names map to user-controlled paths.

**[Inheritance](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.inheritance.php)**
- Subclassing the classes can aid in centralization and prevent logic from being repeated. An essential idea for **[Model-View-Controller (MVC)](https://www.javatpoint.com/php-mvc-architecture)** framework audits.

**[Magic Methods](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php)**:
- `__construct`: Called when creating an instance of a class.
- `__destruct`: Called when destroying an instance of a class.
- `__call`: Is triggered when the method/function doesn't exist.
- `__get/__set`: Useful for controlling access to class properties, but can be abused if not carefully implemented (e.g., returning sensitive data).
- `__wakeup`: Often abused in **deserialization attacks**. Always validate or sanitize input when objects are unserialized.
- `__toString`: Converts an object to a string. It is particularly useful in output formatting but be mindful of potential data leakage when implicitly converting sensitive objects.

## Strings
**Quoted**:
- **Single quoted**: No variable expansion, and escape sequences are limited to `\\` and `\'`.
- **Double quoted**:
    - Supports escape sequences (`\n`, `\t`, `\f`,` \`, `$`, `"`, etc.).
    - **Variable expansion**: Variables inside double-quoted strings are expanded, which can be useful but risky if user input is directly included.
    - **Octal and Hexadecimal Notation**: Allows representation of characters in octal (`\nnn`) or hexadecimal (`\xHH`), but using raw binary data in strings should be handled carefully.
    - **Security Note**: Never trust user input inside double-quoted strings unless properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

**Syntax**:
- **Heredoc syntax**: Behaves like double-quoted strings, supporting variable interpolation and escape sequences. Useful for embedding large blocks of text.
- **Nowdoc syntax**: Acts like single-quoted strings. No interpolation occurs, making it safer for embedding user content or large blocks of static text.

## Autoload
**Dynamically loading classes**:
- Instead of manually including files, autoloading automates the process.
- The deprecated `__autoload()` is replaced by [`spl_autoload_register()`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7651509/what-is-autoloading-how-do-you-use-spl-autoload-autoload-and-spl-autoload-re), which provides more flexibility (e.g., registering multiple autoloaders).
- Since PHP core does extensive class name validation, the autoloader's attack surface is limited when it comes to huge Object-Oriented Applications.
- Use backslashes to make the autoloader believe that a file is a namespace if we upload it to the image directory, works on Windows and Unix.

**Security Note**: If an attacker controls file paths or class names, they could load arbitrary code. Always sanitize inputs and restrict paths that the autoloader can access.

**Attack Surface**: Exploiting autoload with file uploads, if an attacker can upload files, the autoloader could execute them if the filename is crafted as a class.

## PHP Configs
The configuration file [php.ini](https://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.php) is located.
- **Apache**: `/etc/php/version/apache2/php.ini`
- **Nginx**: `/etc/php/version/fpm/php.ini`

It can utilize `disable_functions` to disable system commands, it is helpful for mitigation. However, you can get around this:
- Memory corruption for the escape of virtual machines.
- A new method that is unblocked.
- Replace scripts and triggers with ones from another environment

## PHP Wrappers
**PHP Protocols and Wrappers**:
- **file://**: Provides access to the local filesystem. Be cautious of potential **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** vulnerabilities.
- **http://**: Allows access to remote HTTP(s) resources. Can be exploited if improperly used in file inclusion.
- [**php://**](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php.php): Allows access to PHP I/O streams (e.g., input, output, and temp memory streams).
    - **[php://input](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php.php#wrappers.php.input)**: Direct access to raw POST data. It can be useful for reading non-encoded data, like JSON. It is not available in POST requests with `enctype="multipart/form-data"` if [enable_post_data_reading](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.enable-post-data-reading) option is enabled.
    - **php://output**: Allows writing directly to the output buffer of PHP. It behaves similarly to `fwrite()` on standard output (`STDOUT`).
    - **php://fd**: Access to file descriptors. It can be used to read from or write to specific file descriptors like `php://fd/3` to access file descriptor 3.
    - **php://memory**: Creates a temporary stream in memory. The data is only stored in memory, and once the memory limit is reached, it will stop.
    - **php://temp**: Starts with a memory stream and, once a pre-set threshold is exceeded, switches to a temporary file stored on the disk.
    - [**php://filter**](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filters.php): Allows you to apply filtering operations on a stream (e.g., encoding, decoding, transforming data) before reading or writing the stream. [**convert.base64-decode**](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filters.convert.php#filters.convert.base64) can be used to alter input/output streams, which can be exploited in combination with file inclusion vulnerabilities (*LFI*). Example: `php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=config`
- **[zlib://](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.compression.php)**: Accesses compression streams like `gzip`. Handle compressed data with care to prevent tampering or data injection.
	- If attempting to disguise files (e.g., `.jpg` file masquerading as a `.zip` with embedded PHP) just like `echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.php && zip shell.jpg shell.php`, many security systems can still detect content-type mismatches.
	- Then access with: `zip://./images/shell.jpg%23shell.php&cmd=id`
	- **Mitigation**: Avoid allowing arbitrary file uploads in compressed formats, and verify content-types closely.
- **phar://**: Provides access to PHP archives. PHAR files can include PHP objects in their metadata, making them prone to deserialization-based Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the application unserializes data from a PHAR file.
	- To create a PHAR file: `php --define phar.readonly=0 shell.php && mv shell.phar shell.jpg`
	- To access a file within a PHAR: `phar://./images/shell.jpg%2Fshell.txt&cmd=id`
	- **Mitigation**: Set `phar.readonly=1` in production environments to prevent PHAR creation, and avoid unserializing PHAR metadata.
- **[data://](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.data.php)**: Allows inline data to be treated as a file-like stream. It uses the **[RFC 2397](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2397.html)** format, which allows data to be embedded directly within URLs in the form of base64 or plain text. Include external data and PHP code.
	- Only available to use if the (`allow_url_include`) setting is enabled in the PHP configurations.
	- Usage : `data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWyJjbWQiXSk7ID8%2BCg%3D%3D&cmd=id`
	- **Mitigation**: Disable `allow_url_include` to prevent the `data://` wrapper from being exploited.
- **[expect://](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.expect.php)**: Allows us to directly run commands through URL streams and often used in environments where automation is needed for command-line interfaces that require interactive input, such as logging into remote systems or interacting with prompts.
	-  Ensure the `expect` extension is enabled in `php.ini` (`extension=expect`).
	- `expect://` wrapper then pass the command we want to execute `expect://command`
	- **Mitigation**: Only enable `expect://` when necessary, validate input, and consider disabling the `expect` extension in production.

**Security Note**: Disable `allow_url_fopen` and `allow_url_include` in `php.ini` to mitigate remote file inclusion risks.

## PHP Dynamic Evaluation
**Dynamic code execution**:
- **[eval()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.eval.php)**: Executes a string as PHP code. It is one of the most dangerous functions and should be avoided.
- **[assert()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.assert.php)**: Evaluates a condition and throws an error if false. Since it can execute arbitrary PHP code if given as a string, it's another dangerous function.

**Security Note**: Dynamic evaluation functions should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. They open the door to *Remote Code Execution (RCE)* vulnerabilities if user input is passed to them without strict validation.

## Entity
### DTD Entities
- **External DTD**: External entities can be referenced in an XML file, leading to **[XXE (XML External Entity)](https://pvs-studio.com/en/blog/terms/6546/)** vulnerabilities if they are not properly secured.
- **Internal DTD**: Less risky since no external resources are referenced, but care should still be taken to avoid recursive or excessive entity usage (e.g., **[Billion Laughs](https://pvs-studio.com/en/blog/terms/6545/)** attack).

**Security Note**: Always disable external entity loading with **[LIBXML_NOENT](https://www.php.net/manual/en/libxml.constants.php#constant.libxml-noent)** when parsing XML unless absolutely necessary.

Readmore : **[DTD Entities](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_dtd_entities.asp)**

### XML Entities
- **[Internal XML Entities](https://www.w3resource.com/xml/internal-entities.php)**: Defined within the XML document. Safe if controlled, but still needs proper parsing to avoid malformed or unexpected input.
- **[External XML Entities](https://www.w3resource.com/xml/external-entities.php)**: Refer to external resources and pose a higher risk, particularly in environments where sensitive data could be leaked.

## PHP Streams
**[fopen](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fopen.php) and [stream functions](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.stream.php)**:
- Any function that opens or manipulates files can be used to access data streams. Proper input sanitization is required to avoid unintended file inclusions or injections.
- **Security Note**: When handling file streams from untrusted sources, always validate file paths and restrict access to sensitive directories.

## Reflection
**The Reflection API** allows introspection of classes, methods, and properties at runtime. It’s powerful but dangerous in the wrong hands.
- [ReflectionClass](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.reflectionclass.php): information about a class.
- [ReflectionClassConstant](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.reflectionclassconstant.php): information about a class constant.
- [ReflectionFunction](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.reflectionfunction.php): information about a function.
- [ReflectionParameter](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.reflectionparameter.php): information about function’s or method’s parameters.
- [etc](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.reflection.php).

**Security Note**: Avoid exposing reflective capabilities in a way that attackers can manipulate runtime behavior. If used improperly, it can reveal private or protected class members.

# Framework
**Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter**:
- These frameworks provide high-level abstractions for common tasks but require proper configuration.
**Security Note**: Always follow best practices when using these frameworks, like securing route access, preventing **CSRF**, and ensuring proper data sanitization in ORM queries to prevent **SQL Injection**.

---
# Template Engines
**Smarty, Twig, Blade**:
- **Template Injection**: Ensure user inputs are escaped properly when displayed in templates to avoid **template injection** vulnerabilities.
- **Security Note**: Avoid embedding raw PHP in templates, especially in engines that allow PHP execution (e.g., Smarty’s `{php}` block). This can lead to RCE if user inputs aren’t properly sanitized.

# PHP Debugging
- You can use [Xdebug](https://www.yeswehack.com/learn-bug-bounty/white-box-penetration-testing-xdebug) with the Debugger Protocol (DBGP) for communication.
- To defeat ionCube encryption you can use easytoyou.eu.
- If you use VSCode, **XDEBUG_SESSION** is not required.
