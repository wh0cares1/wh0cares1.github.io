```

- Port
	- Source (ephemeral) : It's dynamically assigned, making each connection unique and preventing port conflicts.
	- Destination (fixed) : Identifies the specific service or application on the receiving host (e.g., HTTP uses port 80).

- Flags
	- URG : Signals that certain data should be processed immediately.
	- **ACK** : Confirms receipt of data, ensuring reliable communication.
	- PSH : Forces the immediate sending of data without waiting for a buffer to fill.
	- RST : Abruptly terminates a connection due to an error or attack.
	- **SYN** : Initiates a connection between two hosts.
	- **FIN** : Gracefully ends a connection.

- Sequence
	- To ensure that TCP segments are sent and ordered correctly.

- Acknowledgement
	- Confirms the receipt of the previous segments.

- Options
	- Maximum Segment Size (MSS) : Defines the largest segment of data that can be transmitted and optimizes network efficiency by reducing the need for fragmentation.
	- Window Scale Factor : Expands the window size for data transmission, allowing for higher throughput.
		- New window size = Window size * 2 Window Scale Factor
	- SACK permitted and SACK : Enhances performance by allowing the receiver to acknowledge out-of-order packets.

- Length
	- Specifies how much data is in the segment.

### Data
- Contains the actual payload that is being transmitted.

## Handshake
### 3-Way
<img src="/images/TCP_3WayHandshake.png">
- Ensures both sender and receiver are ready to exchange data.
- Receiver expects the next sequence number from the source is *the same number* as ack.

## Connection Termination
<img src="/images/TCP_ConnectionTermination.png">
- The sender (send FIN) who closes the transmission must continue to receive data until the receiver also decides to close the connection (also send FIN).

---
# Flow Control
- Continuous stream of data without overwhelming the receiver.

## Segmentation
- Ensures that large chunks of data don’t overload the network or receiver.

### Max Segmentation Size (MSS)
- Defines the largest data chunk that can be sent in one segment.
- Helps optimize transmission efficiency by reducing the need for fragmentation.

### Max Transmission Unit (MTU)
- Determines the maximum packet size that can be transmitted in Datalink Layer, usually 1500 byte.

## Buffer
- Temporarily stores data before it’s processed.
- Acts as a cushion, preventing data loss during high traffic periods.

## Data Transfer
<img src="/images/TCP_DataTransfer.png">
- Data that can be transferred from Application Layer equals MTU - (Size TCP Header + Size IP Layer), which is 1500 bytes - (20 bytes + 20 bytes) = 1460 bytes.

## Window
- For example: Sender's buffer is 100 byte, receiver's buffer is 70 byte. 
- Focus on receiver's buffer because the flow is controlled by the receiver.
<img src="/images/TCP_Window.png">
- Packet sent and acknowledged = The data was already sent and received.
- Packet sent and not acknowledged = The data is not received yet.
- Packet that can be sent = The data is ready to sent.
- Packet that can't be sent = The data that is't ready to sent.

### Receiver Window (RWND)
- Informs the source how much data it can receive.

### Send Window (SWND)
- Determines the amount of unacknowledged data that can be in transit.

### Sliding Window
<img src="/images/TCP_SlidingWindow.png">
- If we talk about TCP window, we don't care about packet sent and acknowledged part.
- Only focus on packet that is not received and that is not sent.
- The window size that can be send determined by the receiver window (RWND).

# Error Control
## Checksum
- Detects errors in transmitted data.
- Calculate using formula -ve of (sum of header + data). 
- Read more: [TCP Checksum](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/calculation-of-tcp-checksum/)

## Acknowledgment
<img src="/images/TCP_ACK.png">
- Reduces network traffic by confirming multiple segments with a single acknowledgment.

### Piggybacking
- Combines data and acknowledgment in one segment.

### Sack
<img src="/images/TCP_SACK.png">
- Allows the receiver to inform the sender of the exact missing segments.

## Retransmission
- This is **the heart** of TCP.
- Based on presumptions by the source.
- Ensures that lost or corrupted segments are resent.

### Queue
- Organizes segments that need to be resent.

### Time-out
- Triggers retransmission if no acknowledgment is received within a certain time.

## Out-of-Order Segment
- Receiver didn't receive some segment then receiver use sack to determine which packet that is lost, then sender resend the packet with the same sequence number as the sack.

# Congestion Control
- Balances data flow to avoid congesting the network, which could lead to packet loss.
- Read more : [RFC2581](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2581)

## Congestion Window (CWND)
- Adjusts the amount of data sent based on network conditions.
- Works with the send window to control the rate of data transmission.
- Before, we use receiver window (RWND) to determine send window (SWND), but now we use CWND.
- The formula is SWND = min(RWND, CWND)

## Rules
- Ensures that data flow is adjusted based on both the sender’s and network’s capacity.
- Uses the minimum of Send Window and Congestion Window to determine the actual amount of data to send.

## Slow Start
- Prevents initial congestion by gradually increasing the data sent.
- To avoid overloading the network.
- CWND gradually increase for example: 1, 2, 4, 8, ...
- Read more : [RFC2581](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2581)

## Avoidance
- Minimizes congestion by adjusting the data flow before the network becomes overloaded.
- Uses a threshold to transition from Slow Start to a more stable data flow.

### Threshold
- Defines the point at which the data transmission strategy changes.

## Detection
- **The key** of Congestion Control.
- Identifies when congestion occurs to adjust the transmission rate.

## Keepalive Timer
- Ensures that idle connections remain open.

## Window Scale Option
- Allows for larger window sizes, supporting high-speed networks.
- Read more : [RFC1323](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1323)

## Selective Acknowledgements (SACK)
- Allows acknowledgment of specific segments, improving retransmission efficiency.
- Read more : [RFC2081](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2081), [SACK](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selective-acknowledgments-sack-in-tcp/)
